current cutscene functionality list

objects -used to specify things regarding some events
	requried paramtiters
		"name" - can be anything but more specificly is used to specify what object you are refering to locally withing the config file
		"type" - refers to the name of the object in terms of my-16-bit-life (ie CreepyButterfly, Zombee, CelingBoi, Jeffrey, ect.)
		"genMethod" - refers to how the object is gotten
			"create" - creates a brand new object to use
				"x" - the x position of the new object
				"y" - the y position of the new object
			"hijack" - takes control of the first object of that type in the object handler 
	optional paramiters
		"persistent" - referst to wheather or not this object should stick around after the concustion of the cutscene (true for yes anything else for no) defaults too no	


actions - (use the type paramiter paired with any of these to activate them in the order you want the events of you cutsceen to activate)
	"moveSlow" - moves an object from point a to point b in a manor that doesent involve them telporting
		requried parameters
			object - refers to the object that is doing the moving (referenced by pairing the "name" paramiter with the object name)
			"destinationX" - refers to the x coordinate of the destanation
						or
			"offsetX" - sets the x coordinate destanaion to the current postion of the object + the value of offsetY
			IMPORTANT NOTE: offsetX is calcuater based on the position of the object at the START of the cutsceen not durring the event where this takes place

			"destinationY" - refers to the y coordinate of the destanation
						or
			"offsetY" - sets the y coordinate destanaion to the current postion of the object + the value of offsetX
			IMPORTANT NOTE: offsetY is calcuater based on the position of the object at the START of the cutsceen not durring the event where this takes place

			"middleVelocity" - refers to the max speed the object will reach
		optional parameters
			"startVelocity" - refers to the speed the object starts at (defults to 0)
			"endtVelocity" - refers to the speed the object will end at (defults to 0)
			"startAcceleration" - refers to the speed at witch the object will go from the start velocity to the middle velocity (defults to infinity resulting in reaching max speed instantly)
			"endAcceleration" - refers to the speed at witch the object will go from the middle velocity to the end velocity (defults to negative infinity resulting in an instant stop)
	
	"sound" - plays a sound effect in its entirity before countinuineing the cutsceen
		"path" - refers to the filepath of the sound effect
	
	"music" - changes the currently playing music to the requested song
		"path" - refers to the filepath of the new song

	"text" - displays a textbox with the desired text
		"text" - refers to the text to display

	"playScene" - plays a diffrent cutsceen 
		"path" - the path to the config file of the new cutscene

	"animation" - plays an animation in its entirity before continuing the cutsceen
		"path" - the path to the config for the sprite that causes the animation
		object - the object that plays that animation (referenced by pairing the "name" paraimiter with the object name)
	
	"sprite" - changes somethings sprite to another sprite
		"path" - the path to the new sprite
		object - the object that gets the new sprite (referenced by pairing the "name" paraimiter with the object name)
	
	"custom" - runs custom code that would be writen in a class that implements the CutsceneEvent interface in the runEvent () method
		"customEventType" - refers to the name of the class with the custom code
		all other paramiters would be decided in the custom code as it would have access to the part of cutscene config file that relates to it

chaining - a useful features that allows you to chain multiple actions together causesing them to all happen at the same time (esentially creating one action that does both things)
	paramiter "chainInfo" -(can be used on any action)
		"start" - signifes the start of a chain
		any specifed value other than start (recomended paramiter is "end) - signifies the end of a chain 

	any action inbetween the start and end of a chain will become part of that chain
